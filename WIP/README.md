WIP Features/Changes
======

Welcome to the Work in Progress features subdirectory for F-List's currently in development feature additions programmed by Kali/Maw.

If you wish to beta test some of these additions, look for the corresponding webclient version you use, and copy the body of code within that feature.

Open your browser's F-Chat window, hit ctrl+shift+j to open up your browser's console and paste the code into the console.

You're good to go! If by chance you encounter any bugs (Which isn't unheard of while a feature is in its initial development phase!) Please send me a message/note on 'Kali Trixtan' on F-Chat with the bug in question.

Happy chatting and good day!
